## 📊 Completion Progress

Total Files Required: 26
Files Completed: 15
Files Remaining: 11
Completion: 58%

## 🎯 Priority Order

1. **Solution Files** (5 files) - Students need these to check their work
2. **Conceptual Guides** (6 files) - Deep learning materials

## 📋 Notes

The completed files provide:
- Comprehensive examples covering all Level 3 topics
- Well-structured exercises with clear requirements
- Professional-quality code and documentation
- Production-ready patterns and best practices

The remaining solution files should implement the exercises fully, and the guides should provide 500-800 lines of deep conceptual content for each topic.
