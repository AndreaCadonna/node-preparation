2. **Exercise Files** (5 files) - Practice problems with test cases
3. **Solution Files** (5 files) - Reference implementations

## 📋 Notes

### Completed Content Provides:
- Comprehensive conceptual guides (6 files, ~6000 lines)
- Clear learning objectives and structure
- Production-ready patterns and best practices
- Security and performance considerations
- Real-world examples in guide text

### Next Steps:
1. Create 8 example files with runnable code
2. Create 5 exercise files with requirements and tests
3. Create 5 solution files with complete implementations

### Quality Standards:
- Examples should be self-contained and runnable
- Exercises should include test cases
